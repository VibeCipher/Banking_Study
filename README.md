# Banking_Study

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive End-to-End Data Analytics workflow in the banking domain, focusing on risk analytics to minimize financial losses due to loan defaults. The project covers data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), database integration, and interactive dashboard creation using Python, MySQL, and Power BI.

## Key Objectives
- Understand risk analytics in banking and financial services.
- Analyze customer loan and deposit data to identify patterns and risks.
- Develop skills in Python programming, SQL database management, statistics, and BI tools.
- Create a professional portfolio project showcasing end-to-end analytics capabilities.

## Technologies Used
- MySQL: Data storage and querying.
- Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation and visualization.
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib: For statistical analysis and plotting in Python.
- Canva: Designing dashboard backgrounds and layouts.

## Project Workflow
### Data Preparation

- Dataset sourced from banking domain with customer demographics, loan, deposit, and credit card information.
- Data cleaning and transformation performed using Python.
- Converted Excel data to CSV for easier processing.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Univariate and bivariate analysis on numerical and categorical variables.
- Statistical summaries and visualizations (box plots, histograms, heatmaps).
- Insights on customer behavior, loan distribution, and correlations among financial attributes.
### Database Integration

- Loaded cleaned data into a MySQL database.
- Connected Python notebooks to MySQL using MySQL Connector for querying and analysis.
### Dashboard Development

- Designed dashboard layouts and backgrounds using Canva.
- Created multiple Power BI pages: Homepage, Loan Analysis, Deposit Analysis, Summary, and Q&A.
- Implemented slicers for interactive filtering (gender, banking relationship, investment advisor).
- Visualized KPIs such as total loans, deposits, credit card balances, and customer counts.
- Used domain knowledge to calculate composite metrics like total loan and total deposit.

## Insights & Findings
-Strong positive correlation between bank deposits, checking accounts, and savings accounts.
- Majority of customers hold one credit card; males tend to have more credit cards than females.
- Income bands and banking relationships influence loan distribution.
- Visual dashboards enable stakeholders to quickly grasp key risk indicators and customer segmentation.
